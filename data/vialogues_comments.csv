313385," Earlier in the presentation Mr. Brown makes reference to the fact that at its root, design is a&quot;human-scented process&quot;, by which he means that it doesn't stand as its own autonomous field. Rather, it starts with the subject (who is being designed for?) and works backwards from there. Thus, to be an effective designer one must be familiar with the demographic of those they are designing for. When it comes to our course projects, it may be important to consider a larger narrative and how the project fits into it. In particular, to achieve this will mean becoming familiar with our classmates and the course as a whole.",48648,2018-09-07T00:17:34.000-04:00,,2153,text,2018-09-07T15:53:58.000-04:00,45305
313386," I always thought good design was 50/50. For instance, 50% time and effort on the aesthetics of the design and the other 50% on people. It's so interesting to see on the extent of ""perspective"" aspect you should focus as part of the design process. Which makes sense, since after all you are designing and to create for who is using it.",48649,2018-09-07T01:08:22.000-04:00,,2521,text,2018-09-07T01:08:22.000-04:00,45305
313390," Using design thinking can lead us come up with new ideas and new ways for this course project. As Mr. Brown said: “Design is the way that they create their future”, when it comes to our projects, we should also think of doing something that could contribute our future. Again, since design is based on what people hope and then help people to create things, so we should think of some new ideas and select those good ideas while gradually approaching our projects.",48634,2018-09-07T02:28:50.000-04:00,,1655,text,2018-09-07T02:28:50.000-04:00,45305

313394," As Mr. Tim Brown provides one approach to the purpose of design thinking is to maximize efficiency and ultimately create values such as new strategies and new partnership, design thinking is really there to help think outside the box. As Mr. Brown later mentions the three phases for design thinking, extreme values on the bell curve, rare things that have never happened before later form into inspirations and innovations. Therefore, I personally consider that design thinking is more about the process rather than the outcome, give. It sparkles to think, even though the result may not be satisfactory, one must learn and improve by brainstorming. As designers for the course projects, we need to connect things that may never be connected and find their unique connections.",48654,2018-09-07T03:53:18.000-04:00,,2474,text,2018-09-07T03:53:18.000-04:00,45305

313396," When it comes to approaching projects as designers, one has to think about the real-world implications, how it might solve a particular problem, or how to modernize the system. However, most importantly, one has to explore their environment, which might include researching their industry. These factors can serve as an inspiration. In other words, it has to be applicable. As Mr. Brown has stated, “It starts with empathy.” For instance, in the education industry, designers can think about the flaws or unresolved issues in the education system for inspiration, the age of the children that are targeted, brainstorm possible solutions, and create an experiment that places a priority on external validity. However, it is also important to keep teachers in mind when it comes to design thinking.  Mr. Brown called design thinking a “human-scented process.” In the education industry, design can be thought of as a student-teacher process.",48622,2018-09-07T04:05:33.000-04:00,,3441,text,2018-09-07T04:05:33.000-04:00,45305
313403," After watching this video, I was thinking what is the difference between &quot;Design thinking&quot; and ordinary thinking. In my opinion, the cognitive process people usually use is to think base on their own experience. For example, in most scientific research situations, people search information base of their knowledge (e.g. input keywords they already known). Also, people tend to retrieve memories to deal with similar situations. This kind of thinking often causes confirmation bias, which means you selectively perceive what corresponds with your preexisting hypothesis. Confirmation bias could cause disasters in product development because you are solving your own problem, not the user's. <br /><br />I believe the &quot;Design thinking&quot; is what we can minimize the effect of confirmation bias. By accurately define who the target audiences are, actually watching participants doing their tasks (or doing the task by ourselves), we could have better insights for the problems. <br /><br />This course is a very good opportunity to experience online learning. We can definitely find some inconvenience during the process. For me, English is my second language (and is not good enough) so I need more perceptual cues to understand what speaker was saying. I had a very hard time watching the &quot;video in this video&quot;. I could barely recognize the words in the sentences even repeated for several times. The sound was not clear enough to make me understand...",48635,2018-09-07T05:27:30.000-04:00,,3029,text,2018-09-07T19:06:51.000-04:00,45305
313404," I learned about the importance of design thinking, it can be used in different environment and make variety results. Design thinking is the crucial part for innovation. I strongly agree with the three important words for design thinking: Inspiration, Ideation, implementation. This video makes me realize design research is a inspire tool rather than predicate opportunities.",48652,2018-09-07T05:39:26.000-04:00,,2985,text,2018-09-07T05:39:26.000-04:00,45305
313405," I was inspired by the 3 phases of design thinking mentioned in the presentation: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Design thinking can help develop our storytelling skills, creativity, logistical thinking, team collaboration, leadership, and implementation capacity for this course project. When we do our projects, we should think about the goals we want to attain or the problems we want to solve. We should also shape our ideas based on people's demands and help them either solve the problems or create things for them. To approach the projects as designers, we need to  think outside of box, select those ideas, and make clear plans to implement our ideas.",48658,2018-09-07T10:08:43.000-04:00,,3037,text,2018-09-07T10:08:43.000-04:00,45305
313452," From Design to Design Thinking, it breaks the illusion that design is all about making things look cooler or prettier. Instead, it leads us to the concentration of process and the sophistication it takes to really understand people on multiple levels. Just as Mr. Brown says, design thinking starts with empathy, and thus observe and listen to stories are of vital importance. I love the idea of storytelling, for it creates an immersive environment to dive into people’s situation and bring the sense of mission to create a better world through design.",48620,2018-09-07T14:26:43.000-04:00,,3059,text,2018-09-07T14:26:43.000-04:00,45305
313470, Having insights as the speaker terms it is certainly important. This broadens the perspective from which we make decisions and it takes us out of our comfort zones to make decisions that might inspire the groups we work with or our organizations and affiliations as a whole.,12480,2018-09-07T15:45:45.000-04:00,,1027,text,2018-09-07T15:45:45.000-04:00,45305
313471," I am surprised about that idea Mr. Tim Brown said that insights come from extreme users. I think the extreme users here not only means the minority of people but also means people's extreme demand. In other words,  to invent something new is a process of meeting people's extreme need and expanding the boundaries of what human can do.  Thus, as Mr. Brown said, it is important for the designer to have a close observation of people and see things from the perspective of them. This gives me an inspiring tip that to gain insight from people rather than just from books.",48630,2018-09-07T15:56:34.000-04:00,,3211,text,2018-09-07T15:56:34.000-04:00,45305
313474, Stories are indeed a good way to give an in depth description of what to expect as part of the design process. I think a more tangible form of story telling will always be more advantageous because it gives a sense of hope and aspiration for similar future products.,12480,2018-09-07T16:05:01.000-04:00,,2311,text,2018-09-07T16:05:01.000-04:00,45305
313476,@Can I am with you on your claim that gaining insights from people trumps insights from books. I think the personal interaction we have with others highlights some expectations that users have that we could not have imagined. Without incorporating the opinions and expectations of others the purpose of ensuring great user experience will not be fully achieved. ,12480,2018-09-07T16:28:05.000-04:00,313471,0,text,2018-09-07T16:28:05.000-04:00,45305
313544,"In the video, 3 phases of design thinking were introduced by the speaker: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Innovation can hardly be achieved without one another. I am highly inspired by a bell-shaped graph, shading two tails, saying ""insights come from extreme users"". The users in the middle may bring greater economic profit, but the users at two sides may raise abnormally needs, and that's where innovation starts at.",48646,2018-09-08T03:01:00.000-04:00,,0,text,2018-09-08T03:01:00.000-04:00,45305

313546," I always love the idea of prototyping and iterating upon concepts instead of waiting for the ""perfect"" model. It's a wonderful approach that can help you move through mistakes inexpensively. I find it interesting that in some of the traditional research circles I've worked in - iterative ""agile"" approaches aren't explicitly referred to, but instead the idea of research not being linear is often alluded to.",48633,2018-09-08T03:11:28.000-04:00,,1569,text,2018-09-08T03:11:28.000-04:00,45305
313553," I believe that design inspires innovation. Approaching design problems is the way to create a future, people investigate the way design contributing to the development of unique product and services in a viable and feasible way. The human design does not always stand as its free field, but it commences with the subject and accomplishes backward from there generating a new idea that’s what inspiration for things might be. It is tough to inspire by other people unless we could sympathize emotionally to understand people on multiple levels which is extremely useful when it comes to designing with cognitive experiences. <br /><br />From the bell shade, it gives an essential idea that insights come from extremely users. Concern about the large portion of the population which is more predictable but not necessarily gives you the most interesting insights. The idea of this project design of this course is to go the ends of the bell curve looking for extreme users, something potential worthwhile, not just maximize efficiency and ultimately create commercialize values. As long as a business model could solve its industry problems or a particular obstacle in society, It will eventually succeed in the history of human business",48657,2018-09-08T07:27:45.000-04:00,,1677,text,2018-09-08T07:27:45.000-04:00,45305
313638," I am impressed by the idea that ""design thinkers use the world as a source of inspiration not just validation"". Sometimes, stereotypes and experiences prevent us from generating new ideas. Mr. Brown points out how to create a new idea: (1) starts with empathy (2) concentrates on extreme situations (3) understands on multiple levels including physical, cognitive and emotional levels. In conclusion, inspiration is people-oriented. For example, design thinking in the education industry, educators and researchers should know students' thoughts in depth, especially those do bad in class, to innovate.",48737,2018-09-08T17:29:10.000-04:00,,2544,text,2018-09-08T17:29:10.000-04:00,45305
313645," I believe innovation is the essential element to promote the social movement, and the design thinking behind innovation is, as Tim said, the way they create their future, to create new strategies, new market etc. Design thinking is now becoming a trend in different industries, but the most companies still follow the stereotype that constrains their ideas inside a limited space. I think design thinking should be advocated in order to enhance the efficiency in our daily lives, by follow the three phases Mr. Tim Brown mentioned in the video: inspiration, ideation, and implementation.<br /><br />However, it is hard just to come up with new ideas without any signs because the innovation comes from the experience. To combined what Mr. Tim Brown mentioned, I suggest we should first follow the prototype, plus the learning from experience in order to achieve whatever will be in the final.",48738,2018-09-08T20:03:32.000-04:00,,1818,text,2018-09-08T20:03:32.000-04:00,45305
313681," this video sheds light upon our common misconception about innovation and over-emphasis on ideation. Instead of mind drifting in the name of brianstorming, inspiration comes from getting out to the real world and empathizing with people. Some useful strategies are introduced such as analogous situation and drawing information from different domains. Also, designing is not problem-solving once for all, iterative prototyping is an essential way to make a design work in different situations. At the same time, getting your design across to others by means of story-telling, instead of cold statistic presentation. All in all, an inspiring video changing daily understanding and intuition about design and setting the stage for innovation by ourselves in the future.",48629,2018-09-08T22:52:33.000-04:00,,3441,text,2018-09-08T22:52:33.000-04:00,45305
313684,"I think it's absolutely important that Brown stresses the importance of ""inspiration"" and ""implementation"" as same as ""ideation"". Good ideas and insights have to be inspired by some unfamiliar experiences instead of coming from the middle of nowhere. It's really interesting to note that stepping out of one's own comfort zone, putting oneself in the shoes of others and experiencing something new, is the key speaking not just of some fields such as cultural and ethnic education, but also of the field of technology and design thinking. Actually, interactions with others and collaboration are applicable to every aspect of our lives.",48757,2018-09-08T22:59:16.000-04:00,,0,text,2018-09-08T22:59:16.000-04:00,45305
313710," From Mr. Brown's lecture we can see that the importance of connecting customers and products emotionally and physically through design thinking, as it increases the chance of success of a product strategy, either breaking into a new market segment, or simply maintaining current market position. I totally agree with the bell shape that extreme customers matter in design thinking. To be honest, I think they are whom matters the most in whether a product is standing out or not, comparing to competitors' products. This is because that people are normally able to stand in the shoes of most of the customers, whom interact the most with company or the market, but not the ones that rarely do so. But if a company could come up with a product that catches the attention of more customers than just the ones that would normally like to interact, it would definitely win.<br /><br />As a result, I'm inspired to think how we could implement design thinking while analyzing products, or education systems. If systems are connected tightly to users, it would probably be effective.",48759,2018-09-09T02:46:15.000-04:00,,2171,text,2018-09-09T02:46:15.000-04:00,45305
313852," I was impressed by Mr. Brown's three phases in design thinking. I completely agree with his idea that inspiration starts with empathy, which means that designers are supposed to always try putting ourselves in others' shoes to know what exactly target users' feelings are and what they really want, and developing an understanding of those people for whom we are designing the products or services is of great importance. It also encourages designers to go out to observe and explore. As Mr. Brown mentioned before,"" the whole world is a source of inspiration for design thinkers"", I believe it is meaningful for designers to experience things and find inspiration.",48732,2018-09-09T21:04:32.000-04:00,,1444,text,2018-09-09T21:04:32.000-04:00,45305
314065," While presenting the chart with three sections of the design phase (Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation) Mr. Brown mentions that most people fall into the trap of spending most of their energy in the ideation portion. He mentions how important that it is to be well rounded in this process, coming up with good inspiration, creating ideas, and then implementing them. I think this underscores the importance of surrounding yourself with people that have different skill sets--ones that can inspire ideas all the way through those who can see through the finishing touches.<br /><br />Much of this discussion has been around physical products so far, but when shifting the lens towards education--whether that be classroom design, instructional design, an educational product-- I think many of the same ideas apply. Design can't be successful unless it has these three characteristics, inspiration, ideation, and implementation. I think it's rare that one person encompasses all three of these traits fully, so choosing your partners and playing off of eachothers' strengths can really benefit.",48772,2018-09-10T02:04:41.000-04:00,,976,text,2018-09-10T02:04:41.000-04:00,45305
314079," I really appreciate how welcoming this toy design group is to new ideas. They respect that these thoughts come in all different shapes and forms. They throw their ideas up on the board and assign it a level of completeness, which I think allows for some great brainstorming. Often is the case that ideas that could result in something, don't ever get mentioned because the owner of the idea is too ashamed to share them in their infancy.<br /><br />Although the clutter of the work space looks a bit stressful to me, I think they really have something going with their ""inspiration"" and ""ideation"". It seems like these designers then pass off the implementation responsibility to some of the larger manufacturers, which I think speaks to my previous point of surrounding yourself with people who have strengths at different points in the design process.",48772,2018-09-10T02:27:52.000-04:00,,2920,text,2018-09-10T02:27:52.000-04:00,45305
314945, As someone who came from non-design/technology background the whole topic was very new and interesting. I can't agree more about the importance of seeing and thinking with the users' points of view.

315588," Mr. Brown stated that a good design thinking comes with three stages: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation. We used to be taught that the ideation is the only part (or at less the most important part) when we are going to come up with some new idea and had neglected the processes of where the idea comes from and how to execute the idea in a better way.",48638,2018-09-11T20:26:31.000-04:00,,982,text,2018-09-11T20:26:31.000-04:00,45305
315609," For getting some new idea implemented in a most efficient way, Mr. Brown talked about we can using storytelling to develop and express ideas whether to our partners or our targeted consumers. In my opinion, this is another way of working with empathy, just as our inspiration can start with empathy. People know better about how you think during the whole process can have a better understanding of your product.",48638,2018-09-11T20:48:10.000-04:00,,2173,text,2018-09-11T20:48:10.000-04:00,45305
316324," I like the idea of incorporating several components of ""thinking"" which excites new insights as a source of inspiration. Also the idea of validation is very interesting to me because it was not necessarily something that I thought of when thinking of design - I was more of the mind of personal interpretation and representation. He speaks of looking through the lens of someone else and not what is of value for one's self.",49015,2018-09-12T19:17:13.000-04:00,,965,text,2018-09-12T19:17:13.000-04:00,45305
316367," Mr. Brown said, design is not ""the"" but ""one"" approach to innovation. I really wonder what the other approaches are. Design here refers to a ""human-centered"" process. Therefore, other approaches, in this sense, may be ""object-centered"", ""decentralized"" or etc..  It also reminds me of Aristotle's four causes of an entity (i.e. Material Cause, Agent Cause, Formal Cause and Final Cause). At the best of my knowledge, none of the causes is centered of why an entity exist.<br /><br />Also, Mr. Brown mentioned, ""designers create things either what they think the world needs or quite often what they think they need, which is perhaps not the most effective way of doing human-centered innovation. But you know that it can work."" Did Mr. Brown contradict his own opinions? What will he do and feel if he works with a designer who is very self-centered? I am very curious about that. <br /><br />Although a social phobia can be an extremely talented artist, the possibility of it is quite rare. If an average person like me who would like to do some innovations, the three stages of design (i.e. inspiration, ideation and implementation) are very practical to follow.<br /><br />In a word, to methodize the process of how designers design is very conducive to empower every human being with the ability to create and become a fully developed figure rather than a means of something or someone else.",48878,2018-09-12T20:26:00.000-04:00,,726,text,2018-09-12T20:26:00.000-04:00,45305
317024," There is a very surprising point about the relationship between innovation and design thinking: what does design do for innovation? When we see so many new technologies, strategies, and markets etc., how did they get created? If we say, design thinking is supported by a broad and rich set of tools and environments, then we can also think this way: the ""new"" here means an ongoing process, it means a development process of various things, and this process can be defined with three phases: inspiration (like sprout and hiddenly grow), ideation (formation of the idea) and implementation (really execute and apply). The boundary of the inspiration should not be limited, at least for a good design-thinker, because good innovation can be inspired by a tiny concept.",48637,2018-09-15T03:09:45.000-04:00,,891,text,2018-09-15T03:09:45.000-04:00,45305
317025," Empathy also plays a great role. If a design-thinker only think about himself, or things merely around him, it won't be a smart idea. The aim should be aiming to understand multiple groups, and also understand them on multiple levels. Great innovation should be a mixer from various aspects. No matter is for ideation or the implementation phase, building things also needs learning at the same time.",48637,2018-09-15T03:10:08.000-04:00,,1417,text,2018-09-15T03:10:08.000-04:00,45305

317048,"I am very impressed that design thinking is not a methodology but a culture. People with a design-thinking mindset activley engage in the projects to obtain an individual experience for them, which is a great way to cultivate and practice empathy. It is a virtuous cycle. People need to start to learn it by doing it. <br /><br />Also, the culture may be contagious. The passion to get the thing to the ground can be spread to any facet of the society thereby people get involved can facilitate the multilateral collaboration.

317140," I think the idea of ""learn by prototyping"" is very interesting. In general, people's original designs are not perfect. As Brown said, the prototype can happen very quickly and inexpensive. It's an effective way to find problems from the prototype and fix them in the next prototype design. I also like the idea of ""a prototype hasn't to be physical but must be tangible"", which means a prototype must allow people to build a picture to have a sense of what you have learned.

I think it's also a challenge to make a prototype that is fully capable of showing the finished product and being cheap.",48872,2018-09-17T00:25:01.000-04:00,,1469,text,2018-09-17T00:25:01.000-04:00,45305
317277," I love the idea of ""design thinkers use the world as a source of inspiration not just validation"". It is so true especially for marketing innovation. Before conducting marketing research to figure out whether an idea could work on the market, good marketers tend to generate ideas from their surroundings. They get inspiration from the environment and people around them.",49032,2018-09-17T17:27:44.000-04:00,,1032,text,2018-09-17T17:27:44.000-04:00,45305
317279," I agree with Mr. Brown that marketers of Nike are good story tellers. They use a story to bring an idea alive and get things out into the market. Compared to directly show their products: a pair of shoe or t-shirts to their customer, a good story of products could generate consumers' empathy. Also sometimes stories could help provide the framework for creating ideas and help designers to check if something is missing in the design process. A good story also represents the rationale of design.",49032,2018-09-17T17:35:52.000-04:00,,2208,text,2018-09-17T17:35:52.000-04:00,45305
318866," Mr.Brown's speech make me think about the relationship between design thinking and innovation. Design Thinking is the creation of solutions to challenges  usually based on ‘a human-based approach’, which means considering users and their needs as the beginning point of developing any new product. We can use a design thinking mindset to enroll in a process of innovation, yet unless the process is successful and measurable , it cannot be said to be innovation.",49196,2018-09-21T02:11:39.000-04:00,,3326,text,2018-09-21T02:11:39.000-04:00,45305
317044," Mayer stated that learning is caused by instructional method rather than the media. Thus, when it comes to online learning, a multimedia principle should be applied and it should incorporate videos, graphics such as tables, and more in order for students to see a clear picture of the topic. Also, especially if the multimedia supports the information in the textbook, it might enhance the retention of the information. For example, if an instructor decides to post a video of his lecture, is important to adhere to the coherence principle. Otherwise, some students might either get confused or close it without finishing listening to it. However, contiguity principle is not always feasible as some graphics are too complex and might not permit text next to the relevant part of the graphic. As for segmenting principle, it is more effective. For instance, if a student is confused about a certain section, he or she can watch the video containing that section without having to re-watch the whole lecture. <br />This implies that instructors are supposed to be trained in multimedia instructional design and possess knowledge of these principles and how to efficiently use a video for online learning. Some instructors might be reluctant as it takes time to acquire these skills and to make or search relevant videos. Furthermore, as Mayer mentioned, not all institutions have this technology available since it requires financial resources to hire educational design, cognitive of science learning, and subject matter experts. Moreover, continuous instructors’ training in the use of this technology also requires financial resources. It is also important to note that many students search for videos with explanations of a lecture topic themselves if there is a section in the course material that is unclear to them. Additionally, videos should not replace textbooks or other types of media provided in class. They should only serve as a support to course material and have a purpose. Likewise, as Mayer mentioned, emphasis should be placed on the content rather than production.",48622,2018-09-16T02:22:28.000-04:00,,1124,text,2018-09-20T03:08:48.000-04:00,45306
317209,"Professor Mayer emphasized the significance of visual learning that how you can use visualization to help people learn. For the design of online learning, design graphic makes people learn sufficient since we further know that people learn better from words in pictures than from words alone. In my point of view, I think the designer should concentrate on how to design good graphics including video and how to design good instructional graphics and make a video to help people learn a zero value added the incorporate graphics, not only verbal presentation, especially in k-12 and college education. To look at what is the practical method we can incorporate in video and to keep the presentation simple and focus.",48657,2018-09-17T07:35:21.000-04:00,,0,text,2018-09-17T07:35:21.000-04:00,45306
317311," Mr. Mayer makes mainly focus on two ideas: how significant the visual learning and multimedia will be in the learning process; and how to use design graphics in a most effective way. He mentions a really good point of its all based on instructional method. Instructor/teachers need to understand how to present the idea in a clear way and make students understandable. I believe we have all experienced the influence of visual learning, it helps to trigger our interest and desire to learn, to listen and to understand. However, the most concern is how to use the visual learning/multimedia as an efficient medium to help students better understand the materials and knowledge. And this remains an issue today and needs to be discovered.",48738,2018-09-17T20:52:44.000-04:00,,600,text,2018-09-17T20:52:44.000-04:00,45306

317596," EdTech is a hot topic recently, and more traditional education companies are adding online products to their existing lines in order to catch the trend. Certainly, more animations and vivid activities are better than plain words for learners to understand, but too much interactions may cause information overload. Mr. Mayer mentioned one point in the video: it is the instructional design that ease the knowledge transfer for learners, but not the media. We shall use media as a supplement to the traditional class. Also moderate use of media is highly recommended, and using media in class should never replace textbooks. <br />Also instructor's training on how to use media products is crucial as well. Especially in college where most of the professors are not adept to new technologies, they may get confused with the technologies and eventually not accept the new concept.",48646,2018-09-18T16:32:52.000-04:00,,741,text,2018-09-18T16:32:52.000-04:00,45306
317625," I agree with saying it's not the media/visualization that causes one learn more effectively, but the effective instructional design that integrates media and technology to enhance one's learning quality. Often we have restricted access to a variety of learning mediums in the classroom learning environment in a sense that only having the verbal presentation of the learning materials is not enough. Meanwhile, it got me think of the project-based learning we focused on for the first week. The medium of learning is supposed to be as diverse as possible, in a way that it should correspond with the ways we experience and perceive the world -- we not only see and hear, but we take actions and more.",48757,2018-09-18T17:39:30.000-04:00,,817,text,2018-09-18T17:39:30.000-04:00,45306

He states that just technology available is not useful and we cannot say one medium better than another. When we design video, I think it's good to make the objective clear first, keep the presentation simple and make shorter videos.",48737,2018-09-18T17:47:49.000-04:00,,645,text,2018-09-18T17:47:49.000-04:00,45306
317654," The key points of having videos in the learning process are that video corporate with instructional methods help to learn and a good instructional design causes learning ultimately. Professor Mayer illustrates several principles that what makes a good video, which including coherence principle, keep videos simple and focus on a certain point, contiguity principle, put relevant text next to graphics and voice next to the images, and segmenting principle, break down the complicated materials into understandable pieces. Besides, one thing that we should keep in mind is when we design the instructional method is that we should have the instructional objective in mind.",48638,2018-09-18T19:56:37.000-04:00,,833,text,2018-09-18T19:56:37.000-04:00,45306
317764," As Mayer talks, I soon connect myself to the phrase ""visual learners"". As opposed to verbal learners, visual learners are keen to be exposed to knowledge via graphics, charts, and videos. Yet as Mayer continues, he addresses the problem of not providing good and effective online learning experiences. Personalization is key to online learning and it is the hardest when every single individual is so different from one another. I am engaged in an online course outside of TC and am to learn a specific programming language. The core curriculum is split up into 6 parts; under each part, there are multiple lessons and under each lesson, there are 10 - 30 short video lectures on computing commands with length not exceeding 3 minutes. As I learned, I do believe that this is effective learning as every lecture is very focused; all lectures under a lesson are connected; and all lessons under every part is objectively clear. In addition, the advantage of good online learning design is that learners can also go back to previous lectures and review.",48654,2018-09-19T03:26:48.000-04:00,,584,text,2018-09-19T03:26:48.000-04:00,45306
317787," The usage of video in teaching is advantageous to engage learners, for it can be used to contextualize the information or provide some background information, which can help learners better understand materials, and achieve cognitive interest. But how we apply videos in class matters. I agree with Prof. Mayer's perspective that it is sound instructional design instead of videos that causes learning. The premise is that the class has clear objectives, and then videos could be an effective complement to it. If not, videos  added to the class are likely to be entertainment.",48732,2018-09-19T03:56:47.000-04:00,,927,text,2018-09-19T03:56:47.000-04:00,45306
317962," As professor Mayer said “It is instructional method that causes learning”, neither video nor other new technology could cause study desire. As my understanding, video is just a new medium for learning but the video can not make an instruction become more interesting to students. Instead, it is the instructional content itself. Like Mayer mentioned in the video” Interest should comes from the content itself, not from some external adjunct that you add to it”. I believe it is the instructional method people used could make learning become more interest.",48634,2018-09-19T15:09:47.000-04:00,,794,text,2018-09-19T15:09:47.000-04:00,45306
318208," I think Professor Mayer gives a good point about making videos ""cognitive interest"" rather than ""emotional interest"". I would think that emotional interest would draw more attention to students and let them be more engaged because they ""feel"" more.

318263," Visualizing learning/creating interpretable graphics is important. Multimedia approaches to teaching are essential for online learning and it coincides with theories such as pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman 1986/1987) where representing content in multiple ways is important for learners, and instructors must think deeply about how to represent content in different ways. This requires instructors have a strong subject matter understanding and understand how to pedagogically communicate this to others. <br /><br />There's also work by Tufte about visualizing information and the ethics of doing so.",48633,2018-09-20T00:23:49.000-04:00,,85,text,2018-09-20T00:23:49.000-04:00,45306

318319," I agree with the idea that instructional method is more important than the medium. A good instructional method is crucial in networked learning, it is necessary to put some graphics next to the text for illustrating and strengthing our memory on this text.

However, it is not edtech tools such as video and multi-media, as professor Mayer mentioned, make our learning more efficient, but the appropriate instruction methods and content development. The video production is also important because it has to correspond to specific parts and important ideas where teacher is talking about and learners can feel easy to follow. I remember some data science courses I am taking through an online program. The slides presentation is broken down to several parts with clear graphics and voice next to the contents in the way that I can know which part is important to learn. I believe my learning is more efficient because every course has specific objectives and clear guidance. After the slide presentation, there are several related practices and slide review, which offer me good opportunities to know if I understand the course contents well.",48658,2018-09-20T06:09:06.000-04:00,,1152,text,2018-09-20T06:09:06.000-04:00,45306
318720," Professor Meyer points out three principles in instructional multimedia methods designing: coherence, contiguity and segmenting principle. These three principles provide me with insights into the role and design of video for learning, for instance multimedia methods should present contents in a simple, concise and continuous way in order to make people understand. It is critical that complicated topics should be broken down into several sectors, since too much details will make learners feel overloaded and fail to effective learning.<br />Professor Meyer's view of point to arouse cognitive interest also inspired me. A good instructional multimedia design should impart knowledge in a logic, organized and reasonable way to make students feel interesting about the content itself.",49196,2018-09-20T13:57:22.000-04:00,,1001,text,2018-09-20T13:57:22.000-04:00,45306
318780," I found this to be a highly interesting point. ""It's not really the medium that causes learning, its the instructional method."" All too often, this distinction fails to get made and we get school systems who give all their students iPads and then don't understand why their learning objectives success rate is the same. In regards to designing online learning, we should start with considering what types of instructional methods can effectively be applied to this particular medium. Once that decision is made, actual design should be about implementing that method.",48648,2018-09-20T16:26:18.000-04:00,,249,text,2018-09-20T16:26:18.000-04:00,45306

318806," ""Just making technology available is not enough."" Mayer talks about how it must be integrated with the instruction. I feel like a lot of schools and instructors nowadays are simply throwing technology at learners and hoping that it helps. They see others using video/media and feel like they are missing out if they don't incorporate it somehow, however they don't have ""clear objectives"" as Mayer points out. As more research is conducted, I think it's important to make this actionable and understandable for instructors so they can incorporate these methods with better purpose.",48772,2018-09-20T18:15:37.000-04:00,,498,text,2018-09-20T18:15:37.000-04:00,45306

But it is really hard to achieve such a goal in the industry since headcounts and budget for hiring new people are limited. Besides, though professor emphasize the importance of inherent interest, managers of educational products who are responsible for their sales at the end tend to incentive purchase by making it more emotionally interested to learners rather than cognitively interested, which implies the possible conflict between people on the production side and people on the research side. That would be a thorny issue. How to guide them by research and evidence-based approach like what Prof. Natriello proposed in his paper ""moderate changes, revolutionary possibilities"" is what both sides should work on together.",48878,2018-09-21T11:40:55.000-04:00,,937,text,2018-09-21T11:40:55.000-04:00,45306

317571," I disagree with Siemens’ claim that structured learning is irrelevant for meaningful learning. The structured learning provides tools or instruments, as in, the foundation needed for other forms of learning. It solely depends on an individual on how he or she makes use of these instruments. However, I agree that it is important to form connections, but they are supposed to be meaningful. Moreover, connections cannot students’ knowledge and skills. <br />As for the way the courses are structured in many educational institutions, I agree that, indeed, they are not as effective, especially in terms of connectedness. However, there are Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), which have been founded by George Siemens. Nonetheless, a number of employers do not take them seriously as they prefer a traditional form of education. Hence, it can be said that MOOC can serve as a supplement to the traditional form of education. <br />Overall, in regards to applying the connectivist theory of learning in the creation of online learning opportunities, the instructors of online courses can place emphasis on the interaction or collaboration between students (e.g. discussion posts and group assignments) as opposed to individual papers.",48622,2018-09-18T14:41:23.000-04:00,,905,text,2018-09-18T14:41:23.000-04:00,45307
317609," Every piece of information or knowledge is discrete if learners do not link them together and form systematic understandings of a particular academic area. If it is the case, then those discrete knowledge are likely to be inert, and can hardly be recalled when time passes by. Thus making connection is particularly important in education as it not only helps learners to recall certain knowledge frequently, but also form a deep long term memory for them. In the video, Siemens mentioned that writing research paper is a way to form connection. When learners are collecting reference articles, they are actually putting all connected/related information together, and use references as sources to validate the central thesis statement.",48646,2018-09-18T16:58:55.000-04:00,,909,text,2018-09-18T16:58:55.000-04:00,45307
317642," I am impressed by several statements that Siemens comes up with. For example, he states that schooling system is structured to educate students to mimic and duplicate what they learn to some degree, instead of being structured to create meaningful learning. Education should be structured so that it is not the student that is educated, but that the student educates himself.﻿ Open learning  resolves the problem that formal learning process has. Open learning uses social learning structure that connect learners and transparency enables connectivity among learners.",48737,2018-09-18T18:38:44.000-04:00,,0,text,2018-09-18T18:38:44.000-04:00,45307
317657," It is interesting that Siemens's point of view that open, social learning system is preferred than course system in the most cases. The first reason Siemens mentions is it will be responsive to needs of individuals because everybody have different needs. I am really impressed that he says the test system end up in model that serves institution well, but do not serve students will. I feel the same way since test is not the only scale that evaluate what students learn and what they want to learn. Therefore, connectivism learning style will help students to be more adaptive in the system because they can have different voices and express what they truly perceive during the learning process. However, course system will be applicable under the situation of the stable system, when the body of knowledge is fixed.",48738,2018-09-18T19:58:05.000-04:00,,909,text,2018-09-18T19:58:05.000-04:00,45307
317750," Mr. Siemens raises a point that the formal learning process is irreverent for meaningful learning and the school isn't structural to create meaningful learning for individuals. The most important idea is connectivism. The learners can find their own way to interact with others and the course content, and for the instructor, they can find a better way to introduce the course content in an opening social system. The instructor can focus on the strength of a certain attribute and try to find out why its strengths in that place, which is more effective in teaching and learning.",48638,2018-09-19T03:16:39.000-04:00,,0,text,2018-09-19T03:16:39.000-04:00,45307
317795,"  I agree that each learner has his or her unique educational needs and goals, so traditional standardized education can end up being useless and meaningless in a sense that a large number of students barely recall the knowledge they learned before. There are lots of times that memory may even last only by the end of the exam. Therefore having an open, social, and sharing structure for learners is a good adaptive practice that allows learners to take a full control of their learning based on their own interests, needs, and paces. It also can foster students' engagement and creativity as well. Besides, now that the learning environment is structured to be fluid and adaptive in order to fulfill the needs of different learners, I wonder how assessment tools can be designed to ensure accountability?",48757,2018-09-19T04:33:57.000-04:00,,866,text,2018-09-19T04:33:57.000-04:00,45307

In relation to online learning, I think it can definitely be applied as well. Discussions, forums, online chats, these are all quite easy to implement. I think that is another reason why machine learning has become a rising demand in edTech, it will allow software to be able to also analyze each student's strength and skills through various methods, furthering the connectivism.",48649,2018-09-19T21:54:24.000-04:00,,819,text,2018-09-19T21:54:24.000-04:00,45307

I understand this is largely a philosophical argument but I am curious to see how this works empirically. It also strikes me that this is a primarily pedagogical argument, but how does connectivism connect or not connect to situated cognition or community of practice theories?",48633,2018-09-20T00:15:46.000-04:00,,295,text,2018-09-20T00:15:46.000-04:00,45307

318369," Mr.Siemens believes that structural learning is not good for learners to engage in meaningful learning experiences, but open social learning is. Connections and interactions among community are crucial to make online learning more engaging, interactive, and valuable. Learners are encouraged to share their ideas by connecting with their previous experiences and reply to other people's reflections they are interested in. In this process, learners are motivated to find their appropriate way to develop their understanding of the course contents and independent thinking skills. They can also know their strength and weakness in learning when discussing with others. Therefore, to make online learning interactive and worthy, instructors should emphasize the importance of discussion in effective learning and give some guidelines to enhance the online class interactions.",48658,2018-09-20T07:07:56.000-04:00,,459,text,2018-09-20T07:07:56.000-04:00,45307

In my point of view, we don’t understand everything since we were born, but we can receive to those experiences from other people, like our parents, classmates, co-workers, etc., who become the surrogate for knowledge. Since informal learning has developed a significant character of our learning experience, I personally think that formal education does not provide enough learning experience. However, it is biased to say this, because in our modern era learning and work-related activities are no longer be separated, sometimes they don’t have much distinction, then the majority of our education occurs in a various way like I can share my knowledge with any network or community.",48657,2018-09-20T10:31:05.000-04:00,,4,text,2018-09-20T10:31:05.000-04:00,45307
318795," One aspect of the connectivist theory of learning I found interesting was how strongly it opposes the traditional, formal learning process. In particular, Siemens emphasizes the degree to which we (as educators and instructors) don't actually know our students and thus fail to educate them fully as people. In creating online learning, perhaps users should first share information about themselves which would then help guide the learning process. Additionally, being transparent about this information and personal interests would enable others join in. This creates a collaborative and social learning environment.",48648,2018-09-20T16:55:14.000-04:00,,307,text,2018-09-20T16:55:14.000-04:00,45307
318799," I agree with Professor Siemens that connectivity is playing a continuously growing role between learners and institutions. Specifically, when learners have a strong desire to begin their study in a certain field and they already have concentration areas in this field, it is very important that they could decide what to learn and give feedback about during their learning progress to adjust the learning content and method. <br />However, for learners who are not very clear about their learning objective, structural course might be helpful to give them a general idea and open a door for them into a new world. It is important that student give feedback to make adjustment to instructional methods.",49196,2018-09-20T17:06:21.000-04:00,,865,text,2018-09-20T17:06:21.000-04:00,45307
318807," I appreciate Siemens emphasis on not understanding the background and needs of the learners in a course. It's not practical to understand the prior knowledge and circumstances of individuals in small classroom settings. If we take into account the need to scale education, understanding the needs and circumstances of students is nearly impossible. I think that allow an open, social, and networked base learning environment helps students to build their own knowledge in a way that better suits their needs and background.",48772,2018-09-20T18:38:30.000-04:00,,788,text,2018-09-20T18:38:30.000-04:00,45307
318812," In this sense, online learning is about building an environment where people can build connections and which people can constantly reform and recreate. It is during this process that people learn things. I just learnt about a product that may serve an example for this.

It is thought-provokingif that statement has to be put that way. But it definitely reveals something that we do almost everyday. Instructors teach knowledge from existing textbooks; we learn from our instructors expect us to know. But is it really the way to learn? He also mentions that learning is about connections - getting to know how they are formed. This idea also contradicts with how a traditional course is formed - lectures, assessments through quizzes and exams although more courses nowadays are incorporating project-based learning to better connect classroom knowledge with real-world scenarios.",48654,2018-09-20T19:36:41.000-04:00,,657,text,2018-09-20T19:36:41.000-04:00,45307
318856," The concept that Dr. Siemens convey is intriguing. Although I agree with his point that with the help of open, social learning, we can connect student to all the resource they need including knowledge, discussion and something like that. If the connection is working well, student can learn adaptively. However, I come up with the issue of ""cognitive load"". I don't mean that making connections for students do harm to them, but I think we always need to be aware of not to make tasks too complicated. Just like what professor Mayer said in the other video, we need to make the lesson contents clear and simple. If the instruction for students is not clear enough, students might feel overwhelmed in the open, social learning environment.",48635,2018-09-21T01:31:02.000-04:00,,754,text,2018-09-21T01:31:02.000-04:00,45307
318864," Mr. Siemens mentioned Harvard as an example to state that the current schooling system focuses on having students mimic and duplicate things well, instead of actually learning those things.

318901," The connectivist theory suggests that online learning can provide the good learning activity that serves the student well. Through connected in the network, online lifts the bar for learners from the different background and learning pace. It provides more flexibility for the learner, not more convenience to the institute. So people are going to enjoy the real open, social and adaptive learning .",48761,2018-09-21T08:17:31.000-04:00,,611,text,2018-09-21T08:17:31.000-04:00,45307
320185," According to Connectivism, online learning should no longer be design as a perfectly packaged course with an irrelevant structure as before. Instead, it is supposed to be open and connection-promoted (i.e. social) since we tend to ""think in network"" and science itself is all about verifying the ""linking processes"" we've made in our belief systems. What's more, when the volume of knowledge is exploding, what connectivism suggests is to make all information flow freely in the network and allow students the autonomy to pick out and digest what is useful for them, what makes the most sense to them and etc.. <br /><br />Then, how to make these suggestions applicable? We should notice that Professor Siemens' MOOC is recognized as cMOOCs rather than xMOOCs on Coursera and edX that we are more familiar with. In contrast to xMOOCs which are based on teacher-to-student lectures, participants in cMOOCs ""are all considered teachers AND learners"". The course video is not a must. Participants are able to learn from each other through blogs, learning communities, and social media platforms. These are some elements that other online learning providers can take as references.<br /><br />But on the contrary, although we do ""think in network"", the scope of one's network is not unlimited. When we join online learning communities, some of us may want to build strong connections, but others are more likely to prefer weaker ones. Personally, when I learn online, my purpose is to take advantage of what I learn to strengthen my networks offline, but not vice versa. And I felt a little overwhelmed and anxious when receiving comments from someone I know nothing about. Did those students who finished Prof. Siemens' courses continue to contact each other later on? If the social connection in a learning environment is not the first need, do we really need to spend so much time designing unnecessarily connection-promoted learning experience?",48878,2018-09-24T14:51:55.000-04:00,,900,text,2018-09-24T14:51:55.000-04:00,45307

Aside from teaching students meaningful content, schools also taught students how to learn, how to think critically and foster students' innovative skills.

For one, as Stewart Wallis of the New Economics Foundation points out, a shift in our current economic model as a response to this revolution is inevitable, one that will allow us to meet the basic needs of every human on the planet. Given that goal, online learning seems extremely viable means for extending education around the planet. Already we are seeing this with many instructional computer coding websites. A second reason online learning seems a great option is its efficacy can actually be increased as the technology allows for more immersive learning environments such as the implementation of augmented reality.",48648,2018-09-11T17:54:12.000-04:00,,411,text,2018-09-11T17:54:12.000-04:00,45328

In an environmental aspect, new technology will help the world be sustainable by accessing to clean air, clean water, clean energy etc. On the other hand, in a human-beneficial way, digital technology will benefit on our public education like having the coding class and building robot models to enhance their critical thinking and cognitive skills especially for children; as well as public health will be positively affected by using the 3D printing skills.

316684," The changes in physical, digital, and biological systems of the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have a profound impact on online learning and present new opportunities. The way children seek information and learn has changed immensely, with an inclination towards programming, robotics, and innovation. Some schools are implementing project-based learning and design thinking. In addition to attending classes, children watch online tutorial videos and conduct their own research on topics of interest. Thus, online learning will only expand. It already includes virtual classrooms, online forums, videos, plain text, unlimited number of seats, students from different countries, etc. But, this is only a beginning as new formats will emerge to engage more people. I will not be surprised if, soon, the main goal of schools will just be to present basic concepts, assign innovation projects, and connect students to educational resources. As was mentioned by Peter Maurer, digital inequality will become more visible. In other words, this change will discriminate against people, including unprivileged young adults, who use the internet in inefficient ways and lack Web-use skills (Hargittai, 2010). All of this raises several questions, which are the following: 1) How to spark engage individuals who are not technologically savvy? 2) What type of online learning formats can be introduced in order to engage those individuals who prefer traditional learning, as in, in a classroom setting? And 3) What does the future hold for individuals with a lack of design thinking mindset? <br />References<br />Hargittai, E. (2010). Digital na(t)ives?

This reminds me of an issue of online learning that to what extent teachers' work can be replaced by computers.  From my own perspective, online learning provides a  good platform for students no matter where they are. Some online learning platform also contains an information storage management system where learning documents such as learning materials and student assignments can be well collected and easily accessed. Though these technologies have done many conveniences for learning, I think they are just substitutes for classrooms and folders. The class has to be taught by a human teacher and the platform has to be designed, operated and managed by human beings.

316686," When it comes to the digital inequality, I am surprised that despite young adults having access to the literacy, they do not take advantage of it. I agree with Eszter Hargittai that the best way to think of it is in terms of a spectrum. It is quite alarming that many of them cannot answer those simple multiple choices questions regarding web use skills. One can conclude that those individuals, who are not technologically savvy, just use the trial and error method when clicking something on the internet and if it works, they continue utilizing that function without researching its purpose. Skilled individuals, on the other hand, usually try to expand their skillset by researching; thus, they are more likely to take advantage of the internet as it provides access to literacy. As for schools not offering to teach children computer skills by assuming that those children are technologically savvy, one way to remedy this issue is by making a computer science class mandatory and even offer a research class. Although teachers and librarians provide support, as one can see, it is not enough since many students do not make use of these resources if it is not mandatory. <br />As for online learning opportunities, unfortunately, not every student can take advantage of them due to web use skills and digital use limitations.

Knowing that having ""computer class"" is not usual these days, because it is often seen as ""too obvious"" or ""too easy,"" I think it's important for educational settings to provide at least the minimal education, because it is unfair to expect them to just know about them already.

When considering distance learning, it is inevitable to consider that students from diverse race, ethnicity, quality of web use, and access to Internet. I agree with her that even though the younger generation are savvier in terms of web use just because they live around new technologies more than the older generations, it does not necessarily mean that the younger make use of it in the most efficient way.

I cannot say for sure since I haven't build (in code) any website yet, but I suspect that should be part of the requirements of coding, especially when the correct URL among the four is not a common one.

In terms of one-third of young adults, who were born at the time of technology could not identify the correct description of bcc functionality on a multiple-choice question. This implies to provide digital natives with small contacts that interact with smaller, more flexible but still diverse groups for the design of online learning. So it is not doing any favor to digital natives by assuming they know everything and not offering technological educational support. Another issue is information seeking, which is not so simple to understand. It depends on what a person looking for, and it may require more understanding of searching.

Therefore, I found some of applications and insights she mentioned very meaningful and useful, such as taking advantage of school resources, helping increase the diversity of web use for young students as much as possible.

315596," In this part of the video Weinberger discusses this concept of being ""open"" on the web. He conceptualizes this through the echo chamber visualization in which rather than actually seeking out and reading new, foreign ideas or views on the internet, we are much more likely to simply skim for headlines or find a community that agrees with what we already think thus further reinforcing and propagating our views of the world. In regards to online learning, I think this brings to light a question of what is lost when all of the material is presented in the exact same way to each student as with online learning? Throughout my undergraduate education I had many professors that I liked and some that I didn't but regardless each relationship taught me different things and I think it is often a good thing to be exposed to topics we may not have a ton of personal interest in. In online learning, it seems inevitable that some of this personality in the learning would be lost.",48648,2018-09-11T20:38:16.000-04:00,,2172,text,2018-09-11T20:38:16.000-04:00,45435
316682,"Learning a topic from one perspective cannot actually be considered learning. Furthermore, there is a high probability of confirmation bias. In-depth learning of a topic requires multiple perspectives, and, perhaps, counter-arguments. The internet, indeed, makes us more closed-minded and polarized. When David Weinberger mentioned that there is nothing to compare it to, I disagree, since before, people had to listen to one another’s opinions since they were limited in the ways to socialize. Likewise, they were forced to filter their conversions, which made them ponder about the accuracy of their information.

316683," When it comes to online learning, the goal of every participant is to learn to filter information properly, as in, sort by opinions or facts. Likewise, they should be able to analyze the information presented and, to some extent, critique it. However, I disagree with David Weinberger in regards to the stopping point system. When an individual just receives an instant answer to his question from one expert without conducting an in-depth research himself or herself, his understanding of certain topic is superficial as opposed to reading different sources. Unfortunately, this is a serious issue in modern-day society as people only possess superficial understanding of topics. In regards to information overload, it can be perceived as people not used to dealing with that much information and do not have an ability to filter it. For instance, decades ago, people did not have any trouble reading a whole book, even though it is “bounded” as a medium of knowledge, in one sitting. However, at present time, people constantly check their smartphones, especially social media messages. I believe that the problem pertains more to peoples’ attention span, as in, they are not used to working with that much information. Also, according to David Weinberger, humans prefer to socialize with people with similar beliefs as theirs? Does he suggest that we are all closed-minded to some degree?",48622,2018-09-13T04:12:45.000-04:00,,3080,text,2018-09-13T04:12:45.000-04:00,45435
316864," In the Discussion ""Too Big to Know"", Weinberger pointed out the problem of internet information: too much, disorganized, unsettled , and scattered. Internet indeed provides us with access to information and ideas we want to know. However, that doesn't mean we really know something well. We are overwhelming and fragile in learning things due to information overload. When we learn something online, we learn to filter information properly and only take reference to some opinions or facts we think are 'correct' (some of which are actually not). Like Weinberger mentioned the problem, ""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, not his own facts"". We are also much more likely to find the ideas we agree with. This phenomenon reminds me of the moment when I browse some controversial posts on Weibo and see some false but popular comments. I am surprised to find that if there is one or two comments which stand from truth or are opposite to those popular comments, these 'fewer' people's ideas (or even themselves) may suffer from other users' words attack. It is serious that people don't think about the truth behind the ideas but embrace the close-minded ideas. I think people should be encouraged to have different ideas and question something, just like the comments we received last week in class. We should try to disagree some points and have some different ideas based on our own thinking.",48658,2018-09-14T02:10:13.000-04:00,,2479,text,2018-09-14T02:10:13.000-04:00,45435

We can simply follow the authors’ voice and learn till the very end. Though you may disagree with the author, at least the learning path is both continuous and logic. However, with the possibility of online learning, learners do have more choices and a bigger data bank they can search for. Currently we are exposed to a total new learning mode: it is comprehensive, but chaotic. For example, hyperlinkes are simply everywhere when you open a website, but those links do not necessarily have any logic linkage with what you are looking for. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence is quite powerful in analyzing user preference and recommending similar products to match with users’ tastes. But these non-linear knowledge provision may drag you from your original path. The concept of information overload also applied in online learning platform. Online learning may interrupt learners’ knowledge growth with its discontinuity properties, as a result, learners are more difficult to form a systematic knowledge structure.

In the 20th century, people learn new knowledge through book or newspaper, but now, on the internet, just with a few clicks, we can get thousands web pages and it is impossible for people to read them all. Therefore, people now facing a problem of information overload. So, how can we filter the useful information we need through tons of materials in the web, which everyone could submit something onto it? <br />In the conclusion of his discussion, he talked that &quot;What we have in common isn’t one knowledge about which we agree, but a shared world about which we disagree”. I think people are more encouraged to speak out what they think on the internet, because people don’t know each other in the web so it’s relatively free for them, and most of the time people don’t need to take responsibility for what they have posted online. So, there might be more different opinions on the internet than and thus created more information overload on the internet.",48634,2018-09-14T20:08:01.000-04:00,,2916,text,2018-09-14T20:14:16.000-04:00,45435
316996," Seeing some of comments regarding how we see the limitation or openness of information within the online learning environment, I personally think it wouldn't really create one to be a narrow-minded. Yes, we would have ability to filter out topics that we aren't interested in, but that was available option ever since. It would rather easily create a platform for people with opposite thoughts to gather - without physical boundaries, and each of them will be able to provide stronger evidence by accessing various tools immediately.",48848,2018-09-14T21:20:23.000-04:00,,2016,text,2018-09-14T21:20:23.000-04:00,45435
317007," I find Anna's comment very interesting as she mentions that we live in a world where artificial intelligence enables us to see what we want to see and what we are interested, as opposed to what we should see in a much more diverse way to explore the world. I agree with Weinberger that knowledge is something we human, through time, agree on and acts as a foundation of our learning and thinking. Everyone forms his or her own version of almost everything, which later becomes one's definition of value, outlooks of life, and the world. We cannot judge whose definition is right or wrong, better or worse, it is simply a different perspective that we might not agree on because we are exposed to so many other ideas. Same thing with online learning. From my past experience, online learning for a course often requires lots of readings and writings and often times we are asked to write a research paper on some topic - a typical way to form our thoughts by evaluating two or more sides of a topic. The purpose of reading 20 different sources expressing opposing ideas ignites our way of looking at things. We compare and contrast these ideas using our own definitions and pick a side. And that passes on for other scholars. However, it is certain that there are many many more resources we can check out. Therefore, a research project during our years of education in school is somewhat comprehensive and yet very limited.",48654,2018-09-14T22:02:54.000-04:00,,2040,text,2018-09-14T22:02:54.000-04:00,45435
317015," I believe technology uses and Internet do provide us the convenience and becoming the essential tool in our daily lives. However, in Weinberger's video ""too big to know"" has criticized the concerns behind the big data by mentioning four dimensions: too much, too disorganized, too unsettle and too scattered. As he discussed in the video, he quoted ""there is not such thing as information overload, only filter failure"" represents the data is too big for us to understand and look since we are still experiencing information overload, which reminds me of a case that one friend of mine choose a college that is not the optimal one in her situation due to the excessive choices and now she starts to regret the choice she made. The information overload do change our lives somehow in a bad way. The second impression from this video is the quote ""everyone is entitles to his own opinion, not his own facts"" by Daniel Patrick. I understand different people will express different opinions and it is their own business. However, the different voices on Internet somehow will limit one's perspective since they one see what they want to see.",48738,2018-09-15T01:18:20.000-04:00,,2680,text,2018-09-15T01:18:20.000-04:00,45435

317021," In the era of information, what information we can access to has been controlled by algorithm and media for a period of time. I was thinking whether it's good to be an authority telling you which is correct and which is not. In the past, the authority can be well-known scholars, politician or religious leaders. While nowadays what people believe to be true is just consensus among his echo chamber. The technologies are able to detect consensus, user's position and preference and then filter the information, make some information more accessible for you. That is  dangerous. I hope we can alway hear opinions outside of the echo chambers. Opposite opinions stimulates debate, which can give us opportunities to process the information deeply. I believe the solution to give people different opinions but at the same time prevent information overload is a must.",48635,2018-09-15T02:50:53.000-04:00,,2946,text,2018-09-15T02:52:49.000-04:00,45435

317026," It makes me think about the effectiveness of online learning in terms of the value of knowledge, or in other words, the correctness of knowledge. Since online learning might not be regulated or monitored properly, especially for videos uploaded by users to websites like YouTube. However, since I've studied on Coursera before, I tend to believe distance learning websites like Coursera, especially when the courses on those are provided by accredited universities. But it will definitely benefit if distance learning websites and instructors are graded and ranked in some way similar to colleges and universities.",48759,2018-09-15T03:32:41.000-04:00,,1581,text,2018-09-15T03:32:41.000-04:00,45435
317113," Networked knowledge enables the whole measure of human knowledge to emerge in a geometric pattern. Elites obtain benefits in the convenience of the Internet, but the general public at the terminal is constantly the victim of application. According to the video, Weinberger declared that the problem of internet information: too much, disorganized, unsettled, and scattered. He observes at knowledge from another angle, assuming that when pyramidal structures are no longer a reliable way to create knowledge. I also believe with his forward point: the network will replace the pyramid as a way to create knowledge. In my opinion, online learning has several common points: First of all, even I think hyperlinks distract learners, but this can also be seen as a new form of learning knowledge because hyperlinks instantly answer a puzzle and induce learners to continue exploring along their own interests. Secondly, books may not express the essence of knowledge clearly, but networked knowledge may explain to us that the world is not a logically rigorous argument, but rather an intangible huge net that is in control.",48657,2018-09-16T22:07:16.000-04:00,,2929,text,2018-09-16T22:07:16.000-04:00,45435

We don't know what we do not know. Yes, data can help us predict, it cannot give us a final answer. Learning online creates an environment for us to gather more data, and this data can trigger the better development of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and even more possibilities. When there is new technology, people are trying to integrate it into different fields, however, like the speaker pointed out, it has a limit about the world, or the truth (here I can understand that there is not only one truth)networked knowledge may or may not be true about the world, but it is true to the human condition.

317141," What echoes this idea is the epistemological understanding that we are not accumulating knowledge through our history but only constructing paradigms which shift whenever scientific revolution happens( Thomas Kuhn, 1962).  (and knowledge is networked by the speaker). In this light, online-learning should no longer be fact-based but an ""environment"" where people can reach agreement temporarily and cooperate together. (But maybe with some pre-requisite courses first like statistics, equipping us with the ability to understand Big Data structurally first.) Also, the learning tasks are not evaluated by certain authority with right or wrong but by fellows with other criteria such plausibility and feasibility.",48629,2018-09-17T00:29:52.000-04:00,,2020,text,2018-09-17T00:29:52.000-04:00,45435
317147," I believe that technology provided more access for us to knowledge. It is much easier and faster to get exact information we need from the Internet, but at the same time we are likely to omit the process of exploring and experimenting, which actually hampers the ability of innovation and critical thinking. With overloaded information online today, online learning is more than just presenting information or knowledge but should pay more attention to how to guide learners to exploring helpful information in such context. Everyone is entitled to share ideas, values, stories, etc. online today. On the one hand, it is a great chance for individuals to broaden visions by interacting with different perspectives or even debating with each other; on the other hand, some people's values and beliefs are decided by views approved by the majority online instead of independent critical thinking. Therefore, online learning is supposed to provide a platform to embrace and celebrate differences, helping learners improve critical thinking abilities.",48732,2018-09-17T02:50:30.000-04:00,,2945,text,2018-09-17T02:50:30.000-04:00,45435

317269," ""There's no such thing as information overload, only filter failure"" brings up an interesting point. I think there has always been A TON of information available, whether the internet has been around or not. I don't necessarily think there was ever a point where there wasn't ""too much"" information or data. <br /><br />I do think, though, that the challenges have shifted. The internet now serves as a way to aggregate all of this information making it readily available. The burden has shifted from discovering where information exists to weeding out the information that has been aggregated for you but is not relevant.<br /><br />I think this skill is similar to what Harigittai mentions when she talks about being able to differentiate between reliable sources or not. Weeding out information is a skill all the same. When you are presented with an overwhelming amount of information, aggregated in one search result or query, are you able to efficiently find what you are actually looking for?",48772,2018-09-17T16:39:16.000-04:00,,725,text,2018-09-17T16:39:16.000-04:00,45435
317270,"The analogy of linear learning in education is a useful one and I appreciate you bringing it up. I think that books do provide a more structured approach and the voice of the author is more coherent, transparent, and guiding. <br /><br />I'm not convinced that it is better though. As Anna mentions, it can be hard to stay on track, but I believe the challenge of navigating through autonomous online learning is rewarding in itself. It allows learners to be more engaged and responsible for their own outcomes, and allows more creativity in what those outcomes actually are.<br /><br />Regardless of ""which is better,"" I think you bring up a valuable point that learners should set solid goals. These goals can help to stay on track, measure effectiveness, and mimic a similar linearity that the linearity of a traditional book approach.",48772,2018-09-17T16:46:14.000-04:00,316956,0,text,2018-09-17T16:46:14.000-04:00,45435
317272,I love the Kuhn reference! Although I don't know if Kuhn's point was that we are not accumulating knowledge through our history but only constructing paradigms. The change from one paradigm to another results in learning things or understanding things that wouldn't be possible if this new paradigm didn't exist. This doesn't mean we don't acquire knowledge though. ,48633,2018-09-17T16:53:48.000-04:00,317141,0,text,2018-09-17T16:53:48.000-04:00,45435

There are more forums and subcultures that arise and people who wouldn't be able to connect to each other are able to do so now. I also think there is, with automated filtering systems, more homogenization. As an example, think about political parties within the USA - it seems that over the past two years there have been ""far left"" groups and ""far right"" groups developing as a response to the ""far left"".

317275," I find it interesting that Weinberger focuses on knowledge and how its properties change based on the medium. I feel as though he is conflating knowledge and information. I don't think the two are the same. As an undergraduate philosophy major, whenever we discussed knowledge we usually referred to propositional knowledge or - justified true belief. There are different kinds of knowledge - know how or knowing particular sets of skills, for example. It seems that Weinberger is getting at the idea of there is so much information out there which means it is more difficult to interpret. Since information is more difficult to interpret, or since it is easier to develop a superficial understanding, then we end up in a position where we cannot obtain knowledge. <br /><br />I guess I am a bit surprised because Weinberger doesn't seem to tackle the question of ""What is knowledge"" clearly upfront. Even if Weinberger provided a working definition, then I would perhaps be less nitpicky. Maybe this is an unfair assessment of Weinberger, but it's definitely not helpful for my own learning because the speaker began by jumping into how encyclopedias reflect your commitment to knowledge. Is that really the case? <br /><br />Then Weinberger mentions several metaphors to explain what knowledge was and what the Greeks thought knowledge was, but this only served to confuse me. <br /><br />He mentions that knowledge is ""the real stuff we filter out"" from false perceptions or other things. Then he discusses experts and how we can look up their credentials, but I think that this isn't the case especially in contemporary debates. In the US, I think there is a general anti-intellectualism and people will rely on sometimes fake news articles to disprove someone else's points even if they are an expert.",48633,2018-09-17T17:22:51.000-04:00,,676,text,2018-09-17T17:22:51.000-04:00,45435

317357," I think it is the very question of ""quality"" vs. 'quantity' when it comes to information overload. The human being is always bounded by his limited time and effort, no matter if it's the present day or in the past even if we are indeed progressing towards boundlessness in terms of the breadth, depth, and velocity of learning and knowledge acquisition today. However, the technology, the size of the database is growing way much faster compared to the volume of a human brain. That's why we are nowadays more likely to have decidophobia -- the fear of making choices among a great variety of options.  I totally emotionally understand Chieh-An's suspicion about if the world we're living today is truly better than the one before. Therefore, networked/online knowledge may or may not be truer about the knowledge itself, but truer to the human condition as choosing a side to cling on is nothing about the truth or facts of the question but peoples' freer choices of a perspective, an opinion.",48757,2018-09-18T02:21:53.000-04:00,,2952,text,2018-09-18T02:21:53.000-04:00,45435
317577," An interesting question.<br />Q: Why did you write a BOOK on it? <br />A: I am old-fashioned; my parents would be proud if they were here; and the web doesn't yet pay in advances.<br /><br />Books are still there when radios, televisions and internet come to the modern world just like blackboards in education. People not only live ""now"" but also live in ""history"". Technology does change the world in certain ways, but it has not yet interrupted the rule of history. The panorama of the human society stretches out ahead without leaving out prints and patterns that our ancestors made.<br /><br />And what David Weinberger pointed out is nothing new in the history as he said the internet is just revealing some long-hidden truths. My undergrad paper on philosophy is about ""infinitism"", a theory of epistemology firmly contended by Professor Peter D. Klein at Rutgers University (2007). He co-authored with John Turri on a book titled, ""Ad Infinitum: New Essays on Epistemological Infinitism"". Infinitism is a quite old question that can be dated back to Agrippa's Trilemma in Ancient Greek.  (An argument can either be circular, in which theory and proof support each other, regressive, in which each proof requires a further proof ad infinitum, or axiomatic, which rests on accepted precepts. However, none of the three can satisfy a skepticist since they are not thoroughly substantiated.)<br /><br />Nevertheless, Professor Klein argued that infinitism is itself solid and sound to unveil the structure of knowledge, which resonates with Dr. Weinberger here. The fact that the total amount of knowledge is beyond every individual's mental capacity should not be regarded as the evidence that the structure of knowledge could not be infinite. We can of course for the sake of cognitive load set aside some arguments for further discussion, but we can not deny that there are always some questions waiting to be solved as long as we are willing to dig deeply into the topic. And nowadays such a phenomenon is more easily discovered by hyperlinks all over the web page.<br /><br />Then what should we do? Learning by rote is definitely obsolete while PBL and other new pedagogies need promoting. But should memory as one of our superior cognitive abilities be ""abandoned"" so rapidly? Is there a best period of time to train such an ability? And what are better content for us to memorize? We may need customized answers for different people. And filters in ""The Long Tail"" which is also mentioned by Dr. Weinberger in his speech may be a way to find more specialized contents. In practice, so far, ecommerce platforms, like <a href=""http://Amazon.com""  rel=""nofollow""  class=""comment__user-link"" >Amazon.com</a>, have done great jobs on it.",48878,2018-09-18T15:50:34.000-04:00,,2989,text,2018-09-18T15:50:34.000-04:00,45435

319362," MOOC was extremely popular a few years ago because it made learning more accessible and cheaper, but its popularity is gradually declining in recent years, largely due to its lack of educational goals. In the beginning, Professor Siemens mentioned that AI would replace manual labor, so more and more people are taking career-oriented or skill-oriented lessons online. The phenomena Professor Siemens mentioned matches with my finding. Teachers College provides free MOOC (<a href=""http://Lynda.com""  rel=""nofollow""  class=""comment__user-link"" >Lynda.com</a>) for its students, and when I first opened this website, the top recommendations were courses like “SQL essential training”, “Python in Business”, and “How to be a Web Designer” etc. Certainly, those lessons can have an impact in a short run, but the essence of education is more than securing a job or mastering a skill. Education is a lifelong lesson - it is more about making learners kinder and gentler, shaping their values and making our society better. From my point of view, MOOC should only be a small fraction of learning because it lacks face-to-face interactions between educators and learners. We should not expect courses like that could inject some humanities  into our lives. For universities and other institutions administers, they should set long-term education goals/expectations first, and then integrate MOOC into their systems accordingly.",48646,2018-09-22T18:30:56.000-04:00,,1870,text,2018-09-22T18:30:56.000-04:00,45450

319770," George Siemens mentioned that the labor market flipped in terms of employment and that education is essential. He also stated that if one is from a lower socioeconomic status and does not have access to quality education, he or she is at a disadvantage. How about jobs such as plumbing or locksmith? One does not necessarily need a degree from a university to perform these jobs. He or she might just attend a trade school and have a pretty decent salary. <br />Notwithstanding, in the educational sector, one of the potential reasons as to why tenure track employment continues to decline is due to the fact that many tenure track faculty members do not want to retire due to a decline in 401k. This can be applied to all sectors of the job market as many individuals cannot afford to retire; thus, there is decline in job positions. However, it varies depending on one’s qualifications and industries. For instance, STEM professionals are now in demand.  <br />Also, Siemens wants to make learning more accessible and cheaper? How about the quality of that education? Many employers do not have a high opinion of MOOCs. There are even students who sign up for MOOCs but do not finish them. If students sign up for a for-credit course that will appear on their transcript, they are more likely to take their studies seriously than when they sign up for MOOCs. Siemens even stated himself that there is a lack of educational goals for MOOCs.",48622,2018-09-23T21:04:17.000-04:00,,1866,text,2018-09-23T21:04:17.000-04:00,45450
319939," MOOCs are more like a career-oriented platform rather than an educational online courses platform. In China, there is the status quo that some graduates take accelerated programming courses after finishing the bachelor's degree. Then they are able to find a software engineer position using the certificate, although their majors are totally different from this field. I don't think it is a good circumstance because university is a place to educate individuals, to help them find their inherent interests and to prepare their career. In other words, preparing career is just a small part of education. Education is more about educating people 'who they are'. Graduates should use what they learn in class to find a job, instead of using certificate. The position of universities is being challenged. From my point of view, MOOCs are the supplement of universities/colleges.

320098," I strongly agree with that Siemens point that we need to clarify our expectation on MOOCs. What kind of education do we want to provide and what problems do we want to solve by it. We cannot think that MOOCs can handle everything for us. <br />With the change of the labor market, MOOCs is mainly playing the role in continuing education such as to help adults to find their own career plan, improve the skills in the workplace and build the connection for business. MOOCs are mostly taken in part-time and the knowledge is in pieces, which followed the learning activity of working adults. <br />I found it is a still a question to think that, is the credential, which is a important stimulus for most the MOOCs taker, really represent certain competency? The priority is that we need let MOOCs be more customized for certain employers or employees. It should be more accessible and cheaper but it should not be free to the public because it’s aimless. The employers should place the order for the designer and curriculum needs to know exactly the learning goal. All the money goes with the order not the tuition from individual learners. <br />As Dewey mentioned that it is the internal interest that prompt learning and help to reach the cognitive development. That the MOOCs is more skill-oriented does not mean that I cannot be enlighting. By helping learners to have more insights into the field and supporting more career services, it makes MOOCs a design not longer a rigorous trainer but a real educator to motivate their own thoughts in their career path.",48761,2018-09-24T05:23:37.000-04:00,,376,text,2018-09-24T05:26:29.000-04:00,45450
320343," Professor Siemens in this speech repeatedly emphasized to draw humanity back into the spotlight in the field of education. However, since we are in a post-modern society, it is no longer easy to make a firm assertion of what is fundamentally humane. And even Professor Siemens wrote down on his slides saying, ""connected, not best, ideas win"". Does it mean that he thinks the claim of fundamental values or predetermined goodness is outdated? If so, even though we want to educate for better societies, it's hard to define what is ""better"". Does connectedness guarantee mindfulness and the development of the ""whole person""? Further explanations are needed. And I also hope to hear your opinions on it.",48878,2018-09-24T23:19:12.000-04:00,,1598,text,2018-09-24T23:19:12.000-04:00,45450

320734," Past 7 years have witnessed the development of MOOCs, Siemens suggests teaching should be open, everybody have the same chance to access to learning no matter their background, location, age etc. In the video, Siemens mentions MOOCs help people enters a new stage with creativity, humanity and compassion. Thus, they are able to solve real-world problems and issues using critical thinking and furthermore, in their perspective, they have the higher chances to get their dream jobs. I am really impressed about the final point Siemens brings up in the end of the video, saying the definition of the role of education is too narrow, only giving people knowledge, enhancing their cognitive skills are way more insufficient because bad things still happen in reality. So, the question is how education should be positioned in a right place in order to help with building a better society?",48738,2018-09-25T18:14:51.000-04:00,,1754,text,2018-09-25T18:14:51.000-04:00,45450

321625," ""If you create a view or idea that is disconnected from humanity but driven by technology, in the long run you're going to hit a wall."" Here, professor Siemens comments on Udacity and its founder Sebastian Thrun's realization that the MOOC's really were not an effective way to teach the masses. What I would look like to dig deeper on is why? Why are completion rates so low and what could be done to potentially increase them? I agree with my classmates in that a MOOC can't fully fulfill the role of school and in person learning. But I also feel as though for learning specific skills that an individual really personally wants to learn, they are successful. Perhaps there is a disconnect between instructor and student that is too large and too difficult to be aware of or address online. The lack of consequence and commitment monetarily also surely play a role.",48648,2018-09-26T23:22:42.000-04:00,,633,text,2018-09-26T23:22:42.000-04:00,45450

However, today’s employment social structural tends to have less educators. Mr. Siemens mentioned a point that robot can take place of people’s role in education and that’s what MOOCs doing.

However, I pretty doubt MOOC's ability to fulfill that goal. Professional education -- MOOC mainly concentrates on -- is a part of continuing education in addition to post-secondary education, which should only build upon the general education of each individual.  Therefore, I think merely counting on enhancing access to such a professional education is way too insufficient in terms of education of ""heart"".  In order to really make the society better, we should focus more on general education (primary/secondary), which lays the greatest foundation for shaping us inside out rather than speaking of the aspect of the job market.",48757,2018-09-27T04:41:14.000-04:00,,1812,text,2018-09-27T04:41:14.000-04:00,45450

Remember the previous reading which talks about the importance of teaching where to find information/resources, where to gain knowledge, as important as ""know what"" and ""know how"". Therefore, opening more access to education doesn't really mean those underprivileged people will 100% take advantages of that, as knowledge of ""where to find resources"" at the same time requires a certain extent of knowledge to achieve. Smart people get smarter as they knows how and where to gain that additional knowledge and skills, and the disadvantaged becomes more disadvantaged.",48757,2018-09-27T04:54:49.000-04:00,320871,0,text,2018-09-27T04:54:49.000-04:00,45450

However, George pointed out that we should not exaggerate the contribution of MOOC to education, especially for formal education.

321918," MOOCs have been very popular in the past few years. An interesting point that Professor Siemens addresses is that more and more people take MOOCs to open doors. I do not think there is anything wrong with such purpose. Education remains a life-long journey. Everyday in life we learn something outside of classroom. Many MOOCs are offered in the science field such as programming and engineering. If an individual does not learn a specific skill in school but that skill is required for a certain job, why not? I think that any individual taking a MOOC needs to set his or her own purpose of learning in order to maximize the learning process.",48654,2018-09-28T21:57:58.000-04:00,,1709,text,2018-09-28T21:57:58.000-04:00,45450

However, I think what we need to do is to improve MOOC to make it a great, comprehensive learning tool. For those who can't get into face-to-face learning at the university, MOOC may be their best way to learn university-level knowledge.

It would be likely to result in the extreme popularity of skill-oriented or career-oriented courses, overshadowing other not so ""practical"" courses like humanities, arts, etc., which is opposite to the aim of education that makes a kinder learner and a better society. It also made think that traditional universities could take more responsibilities to prepare ""whole person"" for society, while online courses equip individuals with helpful skills better serving to the society.",48732,2018-09-29T05:39:56.000-04:00,,949,text,2018-09-29T05:39:56.000-04:00,45450
321961," MOOCs enrollment is increasing nowadays, but it is also not surprising that some MOOCs are dead due to the lack of social interactions between instructors and learners, and among peers. The online learning platform indeed makes our learning more convenient and available. Besides, there are more career-oriented or skill-oriented online courses offered to people who want to build professional skills or switch to more popular jobs such as data scientist, software engineer or web developer positions. Like several classmates say, students become more likely to take online programming courses to build related knowledge and skills, so that it can be easier for them to secure a related job. However, education is not just for job hunting. It is more about how we become an independent learner, develop thinking skills that show our professionalism, and communicate with others effectively. I doubt the verification of the certificate in job hunting, since it cannot tell if a learner really masters the knowledge and skills which may be emphasized a lot in formal education. For example, even if students complete all the career-oriented programming courses, they may still feel challenging to handle the advanced code interview questions, such as writing a code according to the questions which are not in the previous practice sets or interview guides. Besides, how can students prepare such job interview and ask higher level questions without knowing well about different companies' coding style and popular insights? In that case, students cannot depend on MOOCs too much, but rather set a clear learning goal in formal education and use MOOCs effectively as a learning tool to enhance their learning skills.

I think the major revolution of traditional formal teaching in classroom and online learning is that how does core content deliver, or interact between faculty and student. There are five factors to affect the whole experience of MOOC class: Engagement and learning success, curriculum and design, self-regulated and social learning, SNA and networked learning, Motivation, attitude and success criteria.  Because of these factors, I think MOOC makes learning a bit more complicated. A lack of face-to-face interaction makes self-regulation become a more important factor. The curriculum design also needs to consider this problem, so the activity could be limited.

It is great that regardless of geographic limitation, they are still able to get access to all these most up-to-date knowledge and information, not being left behind.<br /><br />However, I'm a bit concerned about the efficacy and efficiency of complete online learning specifically speaking of the younger learners(K-6) as they tend to have fewer self-control skills compared to adult/college learners, being more easily distracted from learning.",48757,2018-10-04T05:38:35.000-04:00,,366,text,2018-10-04T05:38:53.000-04:00,45451

Cons: instructor cannot see student's facial expression to infer whether he or she listens or understands. Also, interaction and socialization may impair as Veronica says. Lacking socialization with peers is not good for the children's grow-up.

323534," It is surprising to know that distant learning emerged from such an early age. I agree with Qingying that innovations happen for a reason and such ideas must have come from somewhere to solve problems. I also agree that with younger children who have not developed their self-control, it is questionable of how effective distant learning would work. In addition, traditional classroom teaching enables children to gather around and do all kinds of group project with different classmates.

This advantage can make the distance learning an ideal way to enrich student's curriculum.  It helps children to have a deeper understanding of the latest technology (I guess radio might be very trendy at that time) by using them. The unique experience brings them unforgettable memories so I think it has more potential for training and practice. However, we need to be critical about the content we are going to teach in this similar way.

The organization established in 1944. At first, the courses were one-way radio broadcasts. Then they added some question and answer segment. In 1955, they held ""Get-together"" event for the students. In 1960, the teacher embarked the first official patrol to difference stations and spent half day at each station. In 1974, assignments were sent to the students, marked and returned from the school.

From the video and Wikipedia, lessons are delivered in live one-way video and clear two-way audio.

323759," I found this super impressive and interesting to watch. One defining characteristic of this distance learning is that it is taking place in real time with all participants present at once. While this may reduce some of the potential gains of distance learning such as convenience, I think that it is probably a more effective means of teaching/learning. Additionally, because it is occurring in real time, the lesson itself is more fleeting so students may be more likely to pay attention and ask questions while their instructor is available.",48648,2018-10-07T17:38:45.000-04:00,,195,text,2018-10-07T17:38:45.000-04:00,45451

There are cases when information provided to learners might already be considered outdated. For instance, it takes time for academic articles to undergo the peer-review process and the updated information to appear in textbooks. However, the libraries envisioned by Rainie might remedy this issue to some extent. As Rainie mentioned, people “chronicle” every event that occurs in their lives. Likewise, due to the popularity of social networks, people access the accuracy and validity of the information that appears on the feeds, thereby, creating a learning community. It introduces people to the type of information that they might not have known about but it might evoke their interest in researching it. The librarians act as arbitrators in the Rainie’s proposed model of libraries. This presents an opportunity for learning communities to interact with the librarians. In other words, both educators and learners can benefit from this model of libraries.",48622,2018-10-14T18:06:32.000-04:00,,3471,text,2018-10-14T18:15:30.000-04:00,45453

Given the fact that learning has come to be a 'process' and knowledge tends to be fluid and current today, there is no way the librarians can be an expert at anything that they pass down to learners.

Essentially, the goal in this type of consulting is to bring information to individuals that they didn't know about, and thus could not have explored on their own, but that they will care about once it has been brought to their attention. This reminds me of a point Dr. Natriello brought up during our last in class meeting where oftentimes he is limited in his exploration by knowledge due to a lack of even knowing the correct word or phrase that he should be searching in order to get to the topic he wants to know about. In response to the posted question, it seems that this is a model libraries could adapt for online learning.

So it does not merely function as storage and management system, the library will carry more information traffic flow. For example, more local events can be held, and the learning and researching in the library will be based on a specific community such as subculture around the place. Time goes by, the learning community may cluster around the local library.

327696,"One of the issues with the filter bubbles is that the algorithm decides for the learner what he or she needs to know. It is a form of adaptive learning. However, it does not enable the learners to explore the online environment on their own. Also, the algorithmic filters conduct calculations based on the data collected from the learner's device. It does not offer the learner multiple perspectives. As in, the information presented to the learner is usually one-sided. Likewise, these algorithmic filters are not as efficient in gate-keeping the information.",48622,2018-10-22T03:37:35.000-04:00,,544,text,2018-10-22T03:41:32.000-04:00,45454

In fact, we are receiving tons of information that particularly tailor to our user preferences, and we may be influenced unintentionally.  While we are surprised by collaborative filtering and the frontier technology, we have to remember that learning needs guidance. If we keep receiving choices that are similar to our old habits, we tend to stay in our comfort zone and not willing to make any change or learn any new knowledge. Just as Eli Pariser says, though filter bubble offers relevant information, it excludes challenges and other perspectives. In short, I hope that technologies can better serve human - to make us better a person and allow us to absorb every kinds of knowledge.",48646,2018-10-22T19:04:55.000-04:00,,527,text,2018-10-22T19:04:55.000-04:00,45454

Personally speaking, I have been encountered with the same situation when I searched online, when I typed ""education"" in Google, the most results show the Chinese education since I always browse the Chinese website online. The information that is tailored to our ideas should be a concern because we could not see any ideas from different type of people with different opinions toward the same situation. I think the Internet is a great platform for us to understand and listen other's perspectives, by applying the idea of ""connectivism"".

Currently, what information we receive heavily depends on the algorithm and our previous behavior. To break through the filter bubble and learn about the world in real, there seem to be two ways repectively. Firstly, we can install some applications that can ""cheat"" the search engine. Secondly,  we can also actively search for something we don't like. But how to solve the question thoroughly?

But it also can mean no things that we don't immediately have interest in. It's an attitude that expects immediate gratification on the topics we engage with.

For instance, many people have been discussing the impact of filtering bubbles on the recent US elections and the Brexit vote. In both cases, a large number of people were shocked by the results. Even those in politics and the press expect the opposite result.

On one hand, it is convenient for us to know what information we are going to seek.

Now, I don't ever go to the second page. Why? Because of personalization.

I do think it is a good point to bring that up because in educational technology we pay much attention to how to facilitate students learning but little attention to teachers' career development. Having spent most their lives with students, experienced teachers are at a very privileged position to observe and understand how people make sense of domain knowledge and how skills grow.

Overall, the fact that adaptive learning system is addictive enables the student to gain knowledge and practice the skill, thereby, reinforcing that knowledge and increasing the students’ success rate. Moreover, the concept of scaffolding is incorporated in the adaptive systems. However, as Professor Brusilovsky mentioned, there are drawbacks to adaptive systems.

331824, I like how progressed-based navigation support in adaptive systems guides and pushes learners as in my experience motivation certainly comes from such full cycles of those ''addictive'' learning activities and reinforcement.

331894," I think the adaptive systems and how they are highly addicting is absolutely imperative for learning. It is obvious to say, but the reality is that a learning platform can be well-designed visually and highly effective from being informed by research and theory, but if it is not addictive and doesn't keep individuals engaged then none of this will come to light. I believe strongly that at the forefront of the design process should be to make it something that individuals will willingly engage with on their own. As Dr. Brusilovsky shows, one way to effectively do this is through implementation of of an adaptive system.

Instead of topic-based structure, which seems to be disparate and thus diluted, it makes more sense to construct based on concepts, which can be organized incrementally in terms of difficulty. Only in such an environment, navigation can be meaningful. From personal perspective, navigation can be progress-based and from social side, we can be navigated by others' movement in this environment.",48629,2018-11-07T02:55:37.000-05:00,,4360,text,2018-11-07T02:55:37.000-05:00,45455

It can be used in home, school, and work settings, which can be transformed into online forms so that learners can learn, think, and adapt at any occasions. In addition to understanding of learners' needs, I think adaptive systems should also requires appropriate scaffolding from teachers, instructional designers, and education product managers which can make individuals' lifelong learning meaningful and personalized. Therefore, I think adaptive learning systems are not just restricted in students' and employees' learning, but also in teachers' career development, and managers' leadership development.",48658,2018-11-07T18:45:37.000-05:00,,1336,text,2018-11-07T18:45:37.000-05:00,45455

The &quot;customized&quot; effect really depends on the way that the algorithm thinks so the different way to count the pattern is very interesting to talk about.  For example, to have an education in the adaptive system, we need to categorize the knowledge and quiz question first and then count student behavior on them. Then for a better review, the system will retrieve the corresponding session for students. So it all up to student behavior patterns to find the fit algorithm and student's age group, study subjects and their motivation should be considered.

The purpose of Wikipedia is to offer multiple perspectives and gather all of the people’s claims. The second aspect is assuming good faith. The main advantage and, at the same time, a challenge of Wikipedia is its openness. As in, anyone can edit the content. Hence, the concept of pending changes would certainly remedy this issue. Nevertheless, it is not considered an authentic source of information. However, it provides ideas or areas which one might want to research in-depth and links from which the information was retrieved.  <br />Although open content communities and consensus decision-making are controversial, they can be considered an alternative to traditional teaching methods and are more effective in a modern day.

332286," I believe a lot of people will use Wikipedia as a searching engine when they encounter new knowledge, and Wikipedia does success as being a powerful encyclopedia. Its openness and community not only enable people to voluntarily contribute to the academic area, but also allow browsers to absorb multi-perspectives and get a comprehensive picture. No matter how open and free a community is, it always needs high-level administrative support. Just as Joseph said, Wikipedia needs openness, but the openness should depend on context. <br />Also, I notice that Wikipedia sometimes shows a banner on top of its page and ask for donation. Out of curiosity, I searched its funding information, and found that it only needs 3 million per year to maintain its website (a very tiny amount compared with Google or Facebook). The biggest advantage that Wikipedia differentiates from other searching engine is that, it is totally non-profit, and aims to build a pure learning community.

It most definitely is a collaborative effort and only works because of it.

This type of hesitance is common in any network though. If there are people that are ""experts"" at the process then newcomers will be nervous. But, many of these situations require participation to reap the rewards of the network, wikipedia is a bit different.<br /><br />You can get a free ride to all of this information without having to contribute anything.

The selection on this group could be based upon some standards, for instance their position in certain organizations or some sort of related certificates. Moreover, there are some posts that contains soft content, that may be able to be edited by the public, as long as the result does not have unsuitable words.

But without proper measurements (like tests) how can we effectively measure schools' outcomes?",48646,2018-11-12T22:34:02.000-05:00,,845,text,2018-11-12T22:34:02.000-05:00,45457
333459," I agree with Will Richardson that test preparation is not equivalent to education. Unfortunately, many teachers are just preparing students for tests as opposed to sharing knowledge and preparing them for the future. Nonetheless, in regards to learning networks, they certainly can advance one’s skills and clear any misconceptions but they cannot replace teachers. In the first example with the piano, the student already had taken lessons and has some background. However, the example with the cinemaphotographer is not the best example as he apprenticed with professionals. Thus, we cannot assume that he learned cinemaphotography solely based on the learning networks. The following question can be raised: what if the information presented in the learning networks contradicts information presented in class on a certain topic? Also, what if the information provided one participant of the learning network contradicts the information provided by another participant? This might confuse the learner. Hence, learning networks can only serve as a supplement to instruction for students in educational institutions.",48622,2018-11-14T03:07:25.000-05:00,,845,text,2018-11-14T03:07:25.000-05:00,45457
333460, Does this emphasize that self directed learning is a form of motivation in itself? This also sheds more light on the concept of learning with a purpose because when individuals know the purpose for which they learn it urges them to keep working harder.,12480,2018-11-14T03:45:53.000-05:00,,74,text,2018-11-14T03:45:53.000-05:00,45457

333473," I agree with Will Richardson that the purpose of learning is not for getting a perfect score on the test. Instead, we should develop independent thinking and social skills, which enables us to adapt to society well. I was reminded of my experience in Chinese College Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) preparation. My teachers just taught me about the strategies and gave me a lot of practice questions which may appear in the tests.  Our teachers also emphasized the seriousness of not getting a high score in the test, such as not being able to enter a good university and secure an ideal job. Luckily, Now, I almost forget the knowledge which is important in the test, and my current life was not impacted by that test. However, what made me impressive was the moment when I and my friends studied together to discuss and solve the practice questions. Such collaborative learning enhanced my understanding of the knowledge and made my learning less stressful. Therefore, how can we encourage social networked learning to enhance our efficiency of test preparation? Except using test scores, how will we measure our learning outcomes?",48658,2018-11-14T06:26:51.000-05:00,,814,text,2018-11-14T06:26:51.000-05:00,45457
333477," It's hard to deny that examination is a way to check if students' study abilities and how much they learned. On the other word, if they can skillfully use the knowledge. It is also hard to say that test preparation is a good way to reflect students' learning ability because there are lots of institutions and tutors would help students to find the shortcut/strategies for getting good grades. I cannot totally agree with Will Richardson cause score is the crucial point for school and some companies to identify the students. If the student is smart but with a bad score on SAT, he will lose the opportunity for going to a good school.  What if some institutions help him get a good grade?  Things might be changed. In my opinion, the thing needs to change is not the test preparation, but is the criterion.",48652,2018-11-14T06:46:02.000-05:00,,845,text,2018-11-14T06:46:02.000-05:00,45457

However, I think they are left without a clear alternative of how else to generalize assessment across many individuals. I work at a firm that put out a report on the impact of Zuckerberg's donation to Newark and we regularly have conversations about the shortfalls of assessment and we make a point to include other metrics as well such as enrollment rates and graduation rates but ultimately test scores are the primary measurement, almost just by default.

With online learning networks, we extend the meaning of education and there are more forms to educate students.

333779," It is a very interesting and paradoxical topic. Will Richardson says that test preparation isn't equivalent to education. However, without test prep, what shall teachers do to measure how well students master the knowledge? In my hometown, the government starts to reform the educational policy, which allows students to take college entrance test twice in high school and ensures students to choose the subjects they prefer. However, some parents complain about this new policy because it actually increase the pressure of students. And recently I have heard that more and more Chinese parents in Shanghai send their children to private middle schools whose tuitions are more than $50k a year. At these schools, students are all from the rich families and nearly 100% students will enroll into elite schools.

Dr. Savickas, the leader of the field of career counseling, found out through his research that role models significantly influence one's career choice and development.
